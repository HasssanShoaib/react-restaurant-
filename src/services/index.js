If you want a taste of the latter, consider ordering the Emily, which is topped with mozzarella, pistachios, truffled sottocenere cheese, and honey. The menu includes salads and a handful of starters, as well as a burger that some meat connoisseurs consider to be among the best in the city."

Too juicy for its own good and downright addicting. Also try the Colony pizza. Many others looked like worth competitors, but the Colony really found its way to my heart. when you start with a great crust, top it with top notch cheese and sauce, you've got a winner."
